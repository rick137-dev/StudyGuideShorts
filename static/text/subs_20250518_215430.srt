Bees

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,800
are

3
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,200
important

4
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,600
pollinators

5
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,000
because

they

7
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:02,799
visit

8
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:03,199
flowers

9
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:03,599

00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:03,999
collect

11
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:04,399
nectar

12
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:04,799
and

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,200
pollen

14
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,600
for

15
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,000
food.

16
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,400
As

17
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,800
they

18
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,200
move

19
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,600
from

plants,

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,600
allowing

30
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,000
for

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,400
pollination

32
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,800

process

36
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,400
is

37
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,800
vital

38
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,200
for
